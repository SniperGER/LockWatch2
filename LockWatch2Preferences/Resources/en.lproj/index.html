			<h2>Version 2.0f-1</h2>
			<p><small>September 28, 2020</small></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Added cases and bands introduced with Apple Watch Series 6 after Apple's September 2020 Special Event, which now results in a total of 13 cases and 121 unique bands.</li>
				<li>Reduced package size by 50% thanks to HEIC conversion. Quality may have suffered a bit, but it's still acceptable.</li>
				<li>Improved case/band selection performance.</li>
				<li>Improved compatibility with HSWidgets (Date & Time).</li>
				<li>If an Apple Watch case is being displayed, user interaction is only possible inside the simulated frame.</li>
				<li>Removed "Beta" from the package name. And yes, that's worth a bullet point because that wasn't intentional.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 2.0f</h2>
			<p><small>September 15, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>Here it is: the final version of LockWatch 2 – live and in color! After working on it for almost a whole year, LockWatch 2 is now officially leaving its beta phase. And even after reporting the "feature completeness" in the last beta, one additional feature made it to the final version: cases and bands! (Only Series 4 and Series 5 supported. Please send your complaints to Apple for not providing Series 3 assets)</p>
			<p>This idea already existed while I was working on Onboarding in Beta 3, but I discarded it pretty quickly. Now it turned out (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yznco">@Yznco</a> on Twitter) that there are actually people who would like this feature. So, here it is. Apart from that, there's nothing new in this version. I've just removed a developer setting that was intended to be used in the beta phase.</p>
			<p>At this point I'd like to say "thank you" again to everyone who supported me – morally, financially, or through issue reports – it's because of you that LockWatch 2 could be completed at this quality level. As a gift, LockWatch 2 will not only be released on Team FESTIVAL, but also soon on Dynastic – at no additional cost. (Updates will still be released on Team FESTIVAL first)</p>
			<p>As a closing note, there's only one thing left to say: Have fun! Tell your friends you've got an Apple Watch on your iPhone lock screen. Continue supporting development through issue report, because even though LockWatch 2 is finished per se, there's always room for improvement. (*cough*Complications*cough*)</p>

			<h2>Version 2.0b4-u1</h2>
			<p><small>September 7, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>This build fixes an issue where settings would be reset unexpectedly, caused by mixing up paths intended for the iOS Simulator with those for the release build.</p>

			<h2>Version 2.0b4</h2>
			<p><small>September 7, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>As of Beta 4, LockWatch 2 is now officially considered feature complete. Thank you to everyone who has reported issues in the beta phase so far! Because of you, LockWatch 2 is near perfect! This beta introduces the last two features: Third-party watch faces, as well as sharing watch faces, inspired by watchOS 7.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Support for third-party watch faces! You can now install third-party watch faces using a package manager of your choice. This marks also the return of the "Binary" watch face, one of the first external watchfaces of LockWatch from 2015.</li>
				<li>Share watch faces with your friends: Inspired by watchOS 7, you can now share watch faces (including customization) with your friends. Even third-party watch faces are supported! And if a watch face is missing, LockWatch will automatically open Cydia, Zebra or Sileo for you to install its package. NOTE: Watch face files from iOS 14 are currently not supported.</li>
				<li>Fixes an issue where the model selection appears twice in Settings. (Thank you, /u/Guanran928)</li>
				<li>Fixes an issue (again) where the "Date" complication wouldn't show up in various faces. This is my fault all alone, after I reworked complications. (Thanks you, Damian V)</li>
				<li>Improvement to animations.</li>
				<li>Various improvements.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 2.0b2</h2>
			<p><small>March 25, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>LockWatch 2 Beta 2 is a complete rewrite of Beta 1. While Beta 1 was just focussing on getting things up and running and showing what's possible in future builds, Beta 2 has been developed from scratch, mostly to fix existing bugs and add new features. So much has changed actually, I may not be able to provide a full changelog.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Completely rewritten from scratch, using the iOS 13 SDK. Which also means every device that uses an A12 processor or later is supported now. Basically.</li>
				<li>Drastically reduced battery drain.</li>
				<li>Preferences: Selected watch faces won't reset and you can select which Apple Watch you want to emulate, if you want to emulate one at all.</li>
				<li>Watch face management: Add, reorder or remove watch faces right from the lock screen. Also, you can reset watch faces to system defaults now.</li>
				<li>Customization: Customize any supported watch face to your taste. Again, right from the lock screen.</li>
				<li>"Watch" integration (limited to iPhone): Sync the watch faces on your lock screen with those on your physical watch, including customization. Or add new watch faces from the "Watch Faces" tab.</li>
				<li>So. Many. Layout fixes. In fact, every layout issue in Beta 1 (as far as I know) has been fixed, and there's almost no glitching whatsoever (at least while I was testing it).</li>
				<li>Did I mention that battery drain has been drastically reduced?</li>
